# API Configuration Setup

## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to securely store API tokens. Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

### 1. Create Environment File

Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Get Regrid API Token

1. Go to [Regrid API](https://regrid.com/api)
2. Sign up for a free trial account
3. Generate an API token
4. Copy your token

### 3. Configure Environment

Edit `.env` file and replace `your_regrid_api_token_here` with your actual token:

```bash
REACT_APP_REGRID_API_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here
```

### 4. Restart Development Server

After adding the environment variable:
```bash
npm start
```

## Security Notes

- âœ… `.env` file is in `.gitignore` - won't be committed
- âœ… Use `REACT_APP_` prefix for React environment variables
- âœ… Keep API tokens private and never commit them to version control
- ðŸ”„ Regenerate tokens if accidentally exposed
